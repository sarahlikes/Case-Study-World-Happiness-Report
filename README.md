# World-Happiness-Report

##World Happiness Report 2015-2019
###Source: This dataset is sourced from Kaggle with a gold star rating and 8.53 rating of usability.
The report is linked to the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and was updated four
years ago.

###Collection & Contents: The scores and rankings take data from the Gallup World Poll which
base their ratings off of the Cantril Scale. The scale is coupled with the following factors:
economic production (GDP per Capita), social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of
corruption, and generosity. In addition, the study compares its rankings to “Dystopia,” an
imaginary country with the world’s least-happy people.
Ethics & Limitations: As referenced in “Understanding How Gallup Uses the Cantril Scale,”
this is only one way of observing and measuring wellbeing, which is centralized more on the
judgment of life progression rather than day to day feelings of individuals. “Research conducted
across countries around the world (Deaton, 2008) indicates substantial correlations between the
Cantril Scale and income. This contrasts with measures of feelings or affect which appear to be
more closely correlated with variables such as social time (Harter & Arora, 2008).” While it might
be interesting in future research to compare happiness based more closely on social aspects of
overall civilian mood, it will be important to consider income’s status in this dataset. I think it
would be equally beneficial to consider areas less tied towards judgment of life status and more
closely to that of social wellbeing such as quality of food, parental leave, and other social
services.

###Relevance: This data set seems to meet the requirements for the Achievement 6 project brief,
as it is open source, includes geospatial components, and meets the size and variable
requirements. Its latest records are four years old, and was provided in the Achievement 6
project brief. In the future, looking at parental leave, quality of food, social services, and
community sustainability, cleanliness of water, and/or accessibility of resources seem worthwhile
to compare to this data set, but for a matter of time to complete the assignment, I may maintain
this dataset as is.
